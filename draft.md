## 1 Background

This paper provides detailed instructions on how to use the NAG Library for Python with kdb+ and PyQ.  The NAG Library contains more than 1,700 mathematical and statistical routines,  and is accessible by numerous programming languages (including Python, C++, Java, Fortran, etc.).  PyQ is an extension to kdb+ featuring zero-copy sharing of data between Python and the q programming language.  The enclosed examples will illustrate how to access routines within the NAG Library for Python using data stored in kdb+.
